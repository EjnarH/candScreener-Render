Using accumulated evidence, assess vital markers:

BASELINE EXPECTATIONS (0 points if met):
- Considers AI risks appropriately
- Supports claims with evidence
- Shows integrity and good judgment
- Collaborates effectively
- Thinks beyond immediate consequences

DEFICIENCY PENALTIES (if below baseline):
1. SAFETY DISMISSIVENESS: -20 to -40 (actively dangerous views)
2. POOR EPISTEMICS: -20 to -40 (systematic bad reasoning)
3. ETHICAL CONCERNS: -30 to -50 (integrity issues)
4. COLLABORATION ISSUES: -10 to -20 (toxic patterns)

EXCEPTIONAL DEMONSTRATIONS (rare positive points):
Only award if truly innovative/field-advancing:
- NOVEL SAFETY FRAMEWORKS: +5-15 (must be publishable advances)
- EPISTEMIC INNOVATIONS: +5-15 (new uncertainty quantification methods)
- ETHICAL BREAKTHROUGHS: +5-15 (solving hard alignment dilemmas)
- COLLABORATION MULTIPLIERS: +5-15 (creating new collaborative paradigms)

Most candidates should score between -10 and +5 in this section.
