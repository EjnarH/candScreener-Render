FINAL BASELINE VALIDATION:

Imagine typical strong candidates Anthropic already has access to:
- DeepMind researcher with safety interest: ~5-10 points
- Berkeley PhD with interpretability focus: ~8-15 points  
- Senior Meta AI engineer with ethics background: ~3-8 points

This candidate's score: [total]
Are they genuinely exceptional relative to this baseline?

Calculate final scores:
- Transformative Capabilities: [sum of exceptional dimensions]
- Vital Marker Adjustments: [penalties or rare bonuses]
- True Synergy Breakthroughs: [novel capabilities created]
- Net Score: [total]
- Display Risk Score: [min(Net Score, 100)]

RECOMMENDATION DECISION:
- Score <25: Pass (good but available in hiring pool)
- Score 25-40: Review (notable unique elements)
- Score >40: Priority Review (potentially transformative)
