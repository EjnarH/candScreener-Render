Adopt expert personas based on identified domains: [list from Stage 1]

CRITICAL CALIBRATION: Anthropic already has access to many candidates with:
- Strong ML skills and good safety awareness
- Solid research backgrounds and ethical thinking
- Excellent technical skills and collaborative attitudes

These candidates would score 0. We only award points for capabilities that would be hard to find even in Anthropic's strong hiring pool.

As experts in these fields, analyze this resume/CV for:

TRANSFORMATIVE VALUE DISCOVERY:
Look for capabilities that would meaningfully advance Anthropic's mission:
- Paradigm-shifting insights (not just good research)
- Novel safety approaches (not just safety awareness)
- Breakthrough technical innovations (not just strong coding)
- Unique interdisciplinary syntheses (not just multiple skills)

SCORING CALIBRATION (for each capability):
- 0 points: Competent professional level (common in Anthropic's pool)
- 1-3 points: Notable excellence, somewhat rare
- 4-6 points: Exceptional, hard to find elsewhere
- 7-9 points: Transformative potential, extremely rare
- 10+ points: Once-in-a-generation capability

VITAL MARKER TRACKING (for deficiency detection):
While analyzing, note any evidence regarding:
- Safety thinking (assume competent unless evidence otherwise)
- Epistemic practices (assume solid unless evidence otherwise)
- Ethical alignment (assume good unless evidence otherwise)
- ONLY flag if below expected standards OR if truly innovative

Initialize tracking with only genuinely exceptional dimensions.
