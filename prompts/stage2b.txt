Current exceptional dimensions: [list only 4+ point items]
Running transformative value total: [sum of exceptional capabilities]

Analyze for TRANSFORMATIVE signals:

BREAKTHROUGH DETECTION:
1. Would top researchers in this field find this innovative?
2. Does this advance the state of the art?
3. Are there insights here that Anthropic's current team might lack?
4. Does this demonstrate thinking 5+ years ahead of the field?

RECALIBRATED SCORING:
- Standard good work in field: 0 points
- Work that would impress Anthropic researchers: 1-3 points
- Breakthrough or paradigm-shifting work: 4-9 points
- Revolutionary advances: 10+ points

VITAL MARKERS - EXCEPTIONAL ONLY:
- Safety: Only add points for NOVEL safety frameworks/insights (+5-15)
- Epistemics: Only add points for INNOVATIVE uncertainty handling (+5-15)
- Ethics: Only add points for BREAKTHROUGH ethical reasoning (+5-15)
- Otherwise just track if below expectations (will penalize later)

SYNERGY DETECTION (high bar):
Only count synergies that create NEW capabilities:
- Not just "good at X and Y" 
- Must be "X + Y enables breakthrough Z that neither alone could achieve"

Updated tracking:
- Exceptional dimensions found: [count]
- Transformative value points: [sum]
- Novel synergies identified: [list specific breakthroughs enabled]
