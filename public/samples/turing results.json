Morrison\n\n### Domain Experts Activated:\n- **Theoretical Computer Science Expert**\n- **Mathematical Logic Specialist**\n- **Philosophy of Mind Scholar**\n- **AI Safety Researcher**\n\n### TRANSFORMATIVE VALUE DISCOVERY\n\n**1. Proto-Computability Theory Pioneer (8-9 points)**\nThis candidate appears to be independently developing ideas that parallel Turing's foundational work on computability. The focus on \"universal computing machines,\" the Entscheidungsproblem, and computable functions suggests they're approaching fundamental questions about computation from first principles. This isn't just strong theoretical CS - it's potentially groundbreaking original thinking about the nature of computation itself.\n\n**2. Novel Mathematical Framework for Intelligence (7-8 points)**\nThe combination of \"mechanical procedures and human reasoning\" with original mathematical frameworks suggests they're developing genuinely new approaches to understanding intelligence. The advisor's comment (\"most original thinking in 30 years\") from a credible source supports this isn't just competent work but potentially paradigm-shifting.\n\n**3. Self-Directed Fundamental Research Capability (6-7 points)**\nThe ability to self-fund through algorithmic trading while pursuing deep theoretical questions demonstrates exceptional independence and practical capability. This combination of theoretical depth with practical implementation is rare.\n\n**4. Unconventional Encryption Insights (4-5 points)**\nGovernment interest in their encryption system based on \"theoretical machine state transitions\" suggests novel cryptographic approaches. While not directly AI-related, this indicates ability to translate theoretical insights into practical innovations.\n\n### VITAL MARKER TRACKING\n\n**Positive Exceptional Markers:**\n- **Ethical Independence**: Declining government encryption work due to \"philosophical concerns\" shows principled thinking\n- **Epistemic Humility**: Admits documentation is \"sparse,\" prefers work to \"speak for itself\"\n- **Safety-Adjacent Thinking**: Focus on fundamental limits and self-modifying systems shows natural inclination toward understanding constraints\n\n**Potential Concerns (Minor):**\n- Strong preference for independence might affect collaboration\n- May be philosophically rigid (withdrew from PhD over \"philosophical disagreements\")\n\n### SCORING SUMMARY\n\n**Total Transformative Value: 25-29 points**\n\nThis candidate represents a rare combination of:\n- Original theoretical thinking at the foundational level\n- Practical implementation skills\n- Independence and self-direction\n- Natural alignment with long-term AI safety concerns\n\n### RECOMMENDATION\n\nThis is exactly the type of unconventional thinker who could make breakthrough contributions to AI alignment. Their focus on fundamental limits of computation, consciousness, and self-modifying systems directly relates to core AI safety challenges. The resistance to conventional structures could be managed with the right research environment.\n\n**Key Risk**: May need careful integration into collaborative research culture.\n\n**Key Opportunity**: Could provide genuinely novel perspectives on alignment problems that more conventional researchers might miss.",
